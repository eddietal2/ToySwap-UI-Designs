# ToySwap-UI-Designs
UI Designs I did for an app named Toy Swap in 2018

The basis of the app was simple: Allow for Kids, or moreso, the parents of kids, to swap out their toys that they no longer want to other kids on the platform in return for one of their own toys.

This was a wireframe / low fidelity design.
